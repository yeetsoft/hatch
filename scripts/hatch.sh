# Hatch from a terminal, in this repository.
#
# Almost nothing happens here any more. Every command - board, next, queue,
# show, start, move, comment, pr, depends, ask, questions, answer, api, config,
# work and go-to-work - is a command of the `hatch` program in src/Hatch.Cli,
# and this file finds it, builds it if it has to, and hands over.
#
# It stopped being the CLI in AERIE-934. The reason is not that shell was the
# wrong language for `curl | jq`; it is that an operator who clones Hatch into
# their own house has no copy of this file on their PATH, and a tracker that can
# only be reached from one checkout is a tracker for one person. `hatch` is one
# binary, published for four platforms, with settings that live with the person
# rather than in a scripts/ directory. `make publish-hatch` makes them; the
# Runner page serves them.
#
# What is left here is two things that are genuinely this file's:
#
#   - The door. `./scripts/hatch.sh <anything>` still works, so CLAUDE.md, every
#     playbook, and every habit built in this repository keep their meaning.
#     Nothing here has an opinion about the arguments; they go through whole.
#
#   - The supervisor. `go-to-work` asks to be restarted as a newer build when
#     its own source changes under it, and a process cannot exec itself into a
#     newer build - something that outlives it has to compile the new source and
#     run it again. That something is this file, which was already sitting here
#     as the parent. See "The supervisor" below, and docs/hatch.md.
#
# Settings are the program's and are documented in `hatch --help`: an exported
# variable wins, then scripts/.env in this checkout, then the per-user file
# `hatch config` writes. Never a key in this repository, either way - Hatch
# ships to other operators, and a key in the artifact is one operator's key
# inherited by everybody who clones it.
#
#   ./scripts/hatch.sh --help     every command, from the program itself
#   ./scripts/hatch.sh <command>  ...and running one
#
# Bash 3.2 compatible on purpose - that is what macOS still ships as /bin/bash.

# started with, and would be until somebody came and stopped it. Work that lands
# at one in the morning does not reach the run that wrote it.
#
# A process cannot exec itself into a newer build - relaunching the same binary
# relaunches the same code, and the new source has to be compiled by something
# that outlives the process being replaced. That something is this file, which
# was already sitting here as the parent. So the runner asks to come back by
# exiting 75, and everything interesting - deciding to restart, letting go of
# the claim, carrying the night's totals - stays in the runner, where
# `make test-hatch` can assert them.
#
# The totals travel in a file this names once per night: a restart that started
# the budget over would be a way of outspending `--max-spend` by restarting.
