Work one Hatch ticket end to end. `scripts/hatch.sh` is the client; read its
header if a call is not obvious.

(From a terminal, `./scripts/hatch.sh work` does this and chooses its own model
and effort from the ticket's playbook. This command is the hands-on version:
same flow, this session, no spawn.)

## Which ticket

$ARGUMENTS

If an issue key was given above, that is the ticket. If nothing was given, take
the top of the todo column:

```
./scripts/hatch.sh next
```

If that says nothing is workable, stop and say so — do not go hunting in other
columns.

## Then, in order

1. **Read the brief.** `./scripts/hatch.sh show <KEY>`. The description is the
   brief and its acceptance criteria are the definition of done. If it has
   children, read them too (`./scripts/hatch.sh api GET
   /api/hatch/issues?parentKey=<KEY>`) — a story's tasks are the actual work.

2. **Say what you are doing, before doing it.** Move the ticket so the board is
   honest about what is being worked on right now:

   ```
   ./scripts/hatch.sh start <KEY>
   ```

3. **Branch from the remote, not from local main.** Another session may share
   this tree, and a branch cut from a local main carries their unpushed commits
   into your push:

   ```
   git fetch origin
   git switch -c <key-lowercased>-<short-slug> origin/main
   ```

4. **Implement it.** House rules apply and are not negotiable for this run:
   build with `make` (`make build`, `make test-api`, `make test-web`) and never
   a bare `dotnet`; no hardcoded domains, addresses, hostnames or people
   anywhere, including in comments; read the pattern file a plan names before
   writing the thing it patterns.

5. **Green before pushed.** Lint, build and tests are the implementer's
   definition of done — the operator does all browser and UI verification, so
   do not claim a screen works, only that it builds. If something is red and
   you cannot fix it, stop at step 6 and say so rather than pushing red.

6. **Commit and push.** This command is the standing ask for both — the usual
   "never commit unless asked" is satisfied by the invocation, and it covers
   this ticket's work only:

   ```
   git push -u origin <branch>
   ```

   Commit subject in house style: `Area: what changed, as a sentence`.

   If you open a pull request, its title is `<KEY> ` and then that same
   subject (`AER-12 Auth: the first Admin` — no brackets, no second colon), and
   the first line of its description is `[<KEY>](<HATCH_BASE>/apps/hatch/issues/<KEY>)`
   and nothing else, then a blank line and the summary. Where Hatch is reached
   at a different address from the one a browser uses, take the line
   `./scripts/hatch.sh work <KEY> --dry-run` prints instead. Record the pull
   request afterwards with `./scripts/hatch.sh pr <KEY> <url>`.

7. **Report back on the ticket, not in the chat.** The ticket is where somebody
   looks in six months:

   ```
   ./scripts/hatch.sh comment <KEY> "<branch>, <sha> — what landed, and what did not"
   ```

8. **Leave it in progress.** Never move a ticket to a terminal column; only the
   operator decides that something shipped. `hatch.sh` will refuse anyway.

## If you cannot decide

A product call, a name that will be lived with, a tradeoff with no technically
correct side — not yours to choose, and not to be guessed at either. You are in
a session with somebody in it, so ask them. Put it on the ticket as well:

```
./scripts/hatch.sh ask <KEY> "the question, in one sentence" \
    --recommend "The one you would take: what it means, and what it costs" \
    --option    "The alternative: what it means, and what it costs"
# ...ask me the same thing here, then record what I say
./scripts/hatch.sh answer <KEY>
```

Name the choices with `--option` wherever the decision is a choice between
things you can already name — they become pressable in the web UI and numbered
at a terminal, and the label becomes the answer text. Prose is for the
genuinely open-ended.

Recording it is not ceremony. An unanswered question blocks the ticket from
being dispatched at all, so a question filed and left unanswered strands it —
and a decision made only in this chat is a decision the next session, headless
and six weeks from now, will make differently.

Anything the repository can settle, settle by reading the repository first.

Finish by telling me the key, the branch, the sha, and anything you left
undone.
