# The CLI - `hatch`, which lives in src/Hatch.Cli. Its own target because it
# is what somebody editing the loop runs, and because it needs neither a
# database nor a node: a stub wire and a stub session are the whole fixture.
#
# Clamped, because an unattended session runs this and nobody is there to press
# ^C: a test that hangs past thirty seconds is killed and named, and a run past
# two minutes is aborted. The whole suite takes under one.

# A built CLI for this machine, so that `hatch.sh work` starts in milliseconds
# rather than spending a few seconds in `dotnet run` deciding whether to build
# first. It is an optimisation and not a requirement - hatch.sh falls back to
# the SDK, and says so if there is neither.
#
# Deliberately still a plain, fast, host-RID Release build. `go-to-work` asks to
# be restarted as a newer build when its own source changes, and hatch.sh's
# supervisor calls this to make one - at two in the morning, between increments.
# The shippable artifact is `publish-hatch` below, which is a different and much
# slower thing aimed at a different consumer.

# Hatch for the first time has no .NET; single-file because the whole promise is
# "put it on your PATH"; trimmed because the alternative is 70MB of framework
# nobody calls.
#
# Each RID lands in artifacts/hatch/<rid>/, which is what AERIE-935's Runner
# page serves from.
