      positioned things inside table cells — the channel combobox's dropdown is
      one — that a scroll box would cut off at the cell's edge. Turning it on

 * put an editing form in a `colSpan={6}` row, nest a second table in a cell,
 * and render a header with no label above the actions column. Passing <thead>
 * and <tbody> straight through keeps every one of those a plain piece of JSX
 * and makes each page's migration a one-line change.
 *
 * What it does own is the appearance, and an opt-in scroll box for the tables
 * that are wider than the page.
