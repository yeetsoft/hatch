/* @hatch/ui - the shared vocabulary and components for Hatch's web apps.
   The tokens are a separate entry point (`@hatch/ui/tokens.css`) because a
   stylesheet is imported by the app's own stylesheet, not by its JavaScript.

   A component's own styles are NOT a separate entry point: each component
   imports its colocated .css itself, so adding a component to an app is one
   import rather than two.

   The cost of that, knowingly: a CSS import is a side effect, so a barrel
   export puts every component's styles in every consuming app's bundle even
   where the component is tree-shaken out of the JavaScript. Both consumers now
   render the whole library - the top bar brought the theme switch and the app
   switcher with it - and admin is slated to use all nine Phase 4 primitives,
   so per-component entry points would buy nothing and cost every import site
   an extra specifier. Revisit if a consumer ever wants a genuinely small slice
   of the library. */
