/* The theme mechanism, with no React in it.

   `auto | light | dark`, persisted, resolved, and written to `<html
   data-theme>` - which is what tokens.css keys its dark palette on.

   This file is framework-free on purpose. <ThemeProvider> is one caller; the
   other is standalone/topbar.ts, the bar that renders on pages Hatch did not
   build with Vite and React (Swagger UI, the logo export). Those pages must
   read and write the *same* stored choice as the apps - a house where the
   theme you picked in admin does not survive the click into Swagger is a house
   with two themes - and importing ThemeProvider to get it would drag React
   onto a static page to run twelve lines of localStorage.

   So the mechanism lives here and both callers use it. The React file below
   holds only what is genuinely React: state, an effect, a context. */
