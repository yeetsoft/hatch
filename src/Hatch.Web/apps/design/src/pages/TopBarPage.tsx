   a specimen's Light and the whole gallery goes light, because there is one
   theme and this is its control. The app-switcher links really do leave for the
   picker, for the same reason - a specimen that mocks the behaviour is a
   specimen that can be wrong about it.

   The <header> each <TopBar> renders is nested inside this page's <article>,
   so none of them is a second banner landmark. Only the app's own bar, above
   the page, is one. */
