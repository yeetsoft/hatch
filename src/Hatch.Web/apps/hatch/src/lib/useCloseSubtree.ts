/* What happens after the operator answers the offer to close a subtree.

   Two screens ask this question - the board on a drop, the issue page on its
   status bar - and one copy of the answer in each is two error paths that
   drift. So the state the dialog needs and the request it sends live here, and
   a page is left with `const closing = useCloseSubtree(reload)` and six props.

   The cascade names its keys. `closeOffer` computed them from the board the
   operator was looking at, and they are sent as a list rather than as a
   `cascade: true` flag the server would expand at write time - the rule
   IssueBulkEditRequest.Keys states in Dtos.cs: a request that re-ran the query
   server-side could act on a row filed between the operator reading the list
   and pressing the button. */
