/* The parent picker's order and its matching.

   Everything in the picker that has an argument in it, in one module with no
   React in it, because `apps/hatch` has vitest and no DOM: the rule goes in
   `lib/` and is tested, and the layout and the keyboard are looked at in a
   browser. What is left in the component is state and event wiring.

   The order is by key rather than by whatever order the board handed the cards
   over in. BoardController sorts by (StatusId, Rank, Id) so the client can
   slice one list into columns, which from inside a picker reads as arbitrary
   and re-shuffles itself whenever a card is dragged. */

 * keeping: the split is on the *last* hyphen because project keys cannot hold

 *
