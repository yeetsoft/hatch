/**
 * The one piece of state behind the battery and its modal.
 *
 * Owned by the nav and passed down, not fetched twice: the modal renders the
 * reading the nav is already holding, so opening and closing it repeatedly
 * issues no request at all, and a refresh from inside it updates both. Two
 * hooks would be two readings that can disagree, which on a number about
 * headroom is the failure worth designing out.
 *
 * Three things move it:
 *
 * - The first load.
 * - A two-minute poll. The server no longer holds a reading for five minutes
 *   of its own - it holds whatever a runner's heartbeat last reported - so
 *   this is what notices a new one has arrived without anybody pressing
 *   anything.
 * - `visibilitychange`. A backgrounded tab's timers are throttled to the point
 *   of stopping, so a tab brought forward after an hour would otherwise show an
 *   hour-old number until the next tick. Focus is not enough on its own: a tab
 *   revealed without being clicked is never focused.
 *
 * Nothing here reports an error. A failure to reach Hatch's own endpoint leaves
 * the last reading in place - and the endpoint's own degraded answer (`stale`)
 * is a reading, not an error. The bar is not where a fetch failure gets
 * announced.
