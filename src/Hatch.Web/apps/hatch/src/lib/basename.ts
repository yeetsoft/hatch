/**
 * Where this bundle is mounted, as far as the browser is concerned.
 *
 * Hatch answers at two addresses, and React Router's `basename` has to agree
 * with whichever one the address bar is showing:
 *
 *   `home.${DOMAIN}/apps/hatch/...` - the bundle in its own right, under /apps
 *   like every other app in the house.
 *
 *   `hatch.${DOMAIN}/...` - the same bundle, reached through the rewrite in
 *   charts/hatch/templates/middleware-hatch.yaml.
 *
 * That rewrite is deliberately server-side, so on the subdomain the path the
 * browser holds is `/issues/AER-12` while the path the API answered is
 * `/apps/hatch/issues/AER-12` - the hostname exists precisely so a ticket link
 * never has to name the prefix. Which means a fixed basename can only ever be
 * right on one of the two: with `/apps/hatch` hardcoded, the subdomain rendered
 * nothing at all, and said so only in a console warning ('<Router
 * basename="/apps/hatch"> is not able to match the URL "/"') with a clean
 * network panel behind it.
 *
 * Matched by whole segment rather than by prefix, the same rule
 * AdminAppMiddleware's gate uses: a later /apps/hatchery would not be this app.

/**
 * An in-app route as an href the browser can follow on its own.

 * <Link> applies the basename; a raw anchor does not. There were two places
 * that needed a raw anchor unconditionally - the summary dialog's "open in a
 * new tab" button (`IssuePeek.tsx`) and the confirmation chicklet's key link
 * (`Confirmations.tsx`), both for the same reason: `target="_blank"` is the
 * whole point and React Router will not open a second document. In the
 * installed app neither does any more - `useStandalone()` (`lib/viewport.ts`)
 * says there is no second document to open into there, so both are now
 * conditional on it, falling back to a routed <Link> instead. On the
 * subdomain this is the identity, and on the house hostname it is what keeps
 * the new tab from landing on /issues/AER-12 with nothing served there.
