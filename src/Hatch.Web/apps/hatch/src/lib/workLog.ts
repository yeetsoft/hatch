/* The work log's arithmetic and every sentence it says, apart from the
   component the way utilization.ts is apart from the battery.

   The hatch app has no DOM test setup and this story does not add one. The
   house pattern instead is that everything worth being wrong about lives here
   and is tested here, and the component is left thin enough to read.

   Three of these are only interesting at their edges, which is where the bugs
   are:

   - Tokens are the headline and dollars are secondary, because on a
     subscription the dollars are notional list price rather than money that
     left an account. But a session that cost a third of a cent must not read as
     free, so the money has enough places to say so.
   - "Undescribed" and "errored" are two different marks and a row can carry
     both. One predicate answers which, so the component never grows two
     conditions that can disagree.
   - Whether there is a work log at all is a question about the subtree, not
     about the entries: an epic whose stories cost money has a log worth drawing
     with no session of its own. */
