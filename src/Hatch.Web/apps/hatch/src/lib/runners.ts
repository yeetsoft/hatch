/* What a runner row says about itself, apart from the page that draws it - the
   way lib/claim.ts is apart from the badge.

   The server hands over four facts and no verdict: when the runner was last
   heard from, how long silence is allowed to last, what it holds, and what it
   was asked to do. Turning those into one word is this file's whole job, and it
   is here rather than in the page because the ordering between them is a
   judgement worth testing: a runner that has stopped answering is *gone*
   whatever it was asked to do, because "we told it to pause" says nothing about
   whether it is still there to have heard.

   Pure functions taking `now` rather than reading it, so a page judges every
   row against one instant. */
