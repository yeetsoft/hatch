/* Everything the leaderboard could be wrong about: the ranges it offers, what
   it reads out of the URL, the podium it takes off a ranked list, and the four
   sentences it says.

   Apart from the page the way workLog.ts is apart from the work log section and
   utilization.ts is apart from the battery. This app has no DOM test setup and
   the leaderboard does not add one; the house pattern instead is that the
   arithmetic and the prose live here with their tests beside them, and the
   component is left thin enough to read.

   Two of these carry a decision rather than a formula, and they are the reason
   the file exists rather than being three helpers inside the page:

   - The presets are computed onto **the server's own bucket grid**, because
     `/work-log/history` snaps a range outward onto that grid before it draws.
     A range already on the grid is what keeps the graph's total and the table's
     total describing one window; a range half an hour off it makes the graph
     legitimately wider than the table, which reads as a disagreement.
   - "Nothing has ever been logged here" and "nothing ran in this window" are
     two different sentences, told apart by `firstSessionAt` rather than by a
     row count - and the page says whichever is true once, at the top, rather
     than three times in three empty sections. */
