/* Where a dragged card landed.

   The board hands the server two neighbours and never a rank - the server owns
   the number (docs/hatch.md, "Rank computation") - so this module's whole
   job is to turn "dropped on that card" into "between these two", and to
   produce the reordered list to paint before the request comes back.

   It is a module rather than a function inside BoardPage for one reason: the
   board can be filtered now, and a drop has to be read against the cards the
   operator can actually see. "Put it under that one" means under the card on
   screen, not under whatever hidden row happens to sit at the same index. That
   distinction has no visible symptom when it is wrong - the card simply lands
   somewhere slightly surprising - which is exactly the kind of thing worth
   having tests for. */
