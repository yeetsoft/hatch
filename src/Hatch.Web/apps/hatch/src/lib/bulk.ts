/* The bulk edit form, and the request it becomes.

   Every field on the form has three possible meanings and the API reads two of
   them from one JSON value: absent is "leave this alone", the empty string is
   "clear this", and anything else is the new value (IssuePatchRequest in
   Dtos.cs). A form control has no absent - a <select> always has a value - so
   the third state is spelled here, once, rather than being reinvented per
   field.

   This is the module the whole page hangs on, and it is separate from the page
   for one reason: getting it slightly wrong is silent. A form that sends
   `parentKey: ''` where it meant to send nothing does not fail - it quietly
   outdents fifty issues. */
