/* The board's filter: which types to draw, and a search box.

   Deliberately dumb, and dumb in a stated way - the board already holds every
   issue in the house in the browser (BoardDto is one request, unpaged), so this
   is a pass over an array rather than a round trip, and it can afford to be
   obvious. Anything cleverer - fuzzy matching, ranking, stemming - would make
   "why is that card not showing" a question with no answer.

   Filtering is the browser's, not the server's, on purpose: the filter is a
   view of the board, and a board that refetched on every keystroke would drop
   the drag it was in the middle of. */
