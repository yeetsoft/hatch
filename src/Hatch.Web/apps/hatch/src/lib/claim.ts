/* What a claim says out loud, and the one judgement a client is allowed to make
   about one, apart from the components that draw it - the way utilization.ts is
   apart from the battery.

   The one judgement is *quiet*, not *expired*. An expired claim never reaches a
   client at all: IssueClaims.Project answers null past the cutoff, on the board
   read and on the issue read alike, so nothing here compares a heartbeat
   against a lease to decide whether there is a claim. What is left is the
   narrower question of whether a claim that exists is being kept up - a runner
   that has stopped answering still holds its lease for a while, and the board
   is worth more if it says so before the lease runs out rather than after.

   Pure functions taking `now` rather than reading it, so a board judges every
   card against one instant and the tests are exact. */
