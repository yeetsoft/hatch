/* The battery's arithmetic and its wording, apart from the component the way
   meter.ts is apart from StatusMeter.

   The hatch app has no DOM test setup and this story does not add one. The
   house pattern instead is that everything worth being wrong about lives here
   and is tested here, and the component is left thin enough to read: every
   sentence the battery says out loud, the fraction its ring is drawn from, and
   the one predicate deciding whether there is a battery at all.

   Two of them are only interesting at their edges, which is where the bugs are:

   - The ring runs down a five-hour window, and a row can arrive with no reset
     instant at all. Unknown is a third answer, not a zero - a ring drawn empty
     says "no time left", which is the opposite of "we do not know".
   - A reading can be older than the poll that fetched it. `state` is the whole
     of that story and `readAt` is how old, so the wording never guesses at
     staleness from a timestamp. */
