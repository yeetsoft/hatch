 * Nothing on this page starts a process, and that is the design rather than a
 * limitation. A press writes down what the board would like; the runner asks
 * for it between increments and obeys - which is what makes it work for a loop
 * in a container and for one on somebody's laptop behind a router nothing can
 * reach. The cost is that a press takes effect at the top of the next pass,
 * after whatever increment is in flight has finished, and the page says so
 * rather than pretending otherwise.
