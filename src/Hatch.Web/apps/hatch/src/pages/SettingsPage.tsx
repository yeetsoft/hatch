/**
 * The two things a Hatch install of its own configures, and the one thing this
 * browser does.
 *
 * Here rather than on the admin app's Settings page because an install with no
 * admin app - which is every install that is only somebody's tracker - still
 * has to be able to set them. They are the same site settings under the same
 * keys, so a token set on the old page is already set on this one.
 *
 * Two fields written out rather than driven from a table of field descriptors
 * the way the admin page does it: two of them do not earn the abstraction, and
 * they do not behave alike anyway - one is a credential that is never read
 * back, and the other is a name that always is. The rules each follows are in
 * lib/hatchSettings.ts, which is where they are tested.
 *
 * The third card is neither: how long a confirmation stays in the corner is
 * remembered by this browser, like the theme, and never sent anywhere. So it
 * is drawn outside everything the server says - the wall being up, or the
 * settings failing to load, takes nothing from it.
