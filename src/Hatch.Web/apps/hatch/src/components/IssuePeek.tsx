 * What a card says when you click it: everything the board already knew, at

 *
 * Key, type, title, column, parent and dates came down with the board
 * (IssueCardDto), so the dialog paints the moment it opens. The description is
 * the exception, and it is fetched here rather than shipped with every card:
 * putting it on the board would slow the request every visit makes to save one
 * on the clicks that actually want a brief. So it arrives a moment later, under
 * its own heading, and can be fixed where it is read - skimming a column and
 * correcting a brief are then the same gesture.
 *
 * The comments and the history are still deliberately not fetched: they are the
 * reason the issue page exists, and so are the title, the type, the column, the
 * parent and the dates. This dialog adds one read, not a second issue page, and
 * it still hands over two ways to go further: the full issue in this tab, or in
 * a new one.
 *
 * That one read also brings the pull request, which shows as the chip the issue
 * page draws, in the row under the key. It rides on the fetch rather than on
 * the card because only this dialog reads it: putting it on IssueCardDto would
 * widen every board payload for a field no card draws. Like the description it
 * is absent until the read answers, so a card that is still loading, or could
 * not be read, shows no chip.
 *
 * It is laid out against the modal's `footer`: the three ways out sit under the
 * body rather than at the end of it, so a card whose brief runs to a page still
 * opens on a dialog you can close. The description gets a box of its own inside
 * that - a paragraph's worth, the same in both views - because the field people
 * open a card to skim should not be the field that fills the dialog.
