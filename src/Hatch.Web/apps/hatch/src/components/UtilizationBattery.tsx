 * an arc from the top. They are deliberately different shapes: they are
 * different quantities, and a second arc would read as more of the first.
 *
 * A window with no reset instant draws the ring as a dashed track rather than
 * as a full or an empty one. "We do not know when this comes back" and "it
 * comes back now" are not the same thing and must not look the same.
 *

 * installation. No element, no placeholder, no reserved space.
