 * What the board is showing: a toggle per type, and a search box.
 *
 * Both are the browser's - the board already holds every issue in the house
 * (BoardDto arrives in one request), so filtering is a pass over an array and
 * not a round trip. That matters for more than speed: a filter that refetched
 * would drop the drag in progress and would make typing into the box a
 * conversation with the server.
 *
 * No types chosen means every type, which is the reading that keeps the board
 * from going blank when the last chip is switched off.
