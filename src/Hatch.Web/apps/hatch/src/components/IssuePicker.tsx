/* Picking one issue out of sixty.

   A native <select> does prefix typeahead on the option's leading text, so
   typing `745` finds nothing when every option starts with the project key -
   the only thing that matches is typing the project key and then the number
   faster than the browser's typeahead timeout. This is a button that opens a
   popup holding a search box and a list, driven by the keyboard end to end.

   Presentational and self-contained, like IssuePeek: it fetches nothing, knows
   nothing about issues beyond the cards it is handed, and every ordering and
   matching decision it makes is made in lib/issuePicker.ts, which is where
   they are tested. What is here is state and events.

   It stays in apps/hatch rather than @hatch/ui. Admin's ChannelSelect is the
   same idea and older, and merging them is a third screen's worth of argument
   - its ranking by match position, its lack of ARIA, its inline styles -
   landing on a ticket about the parent field. The leaderboard's issue filter is
   the second screen, and a third is when a move to the library is worth
   proposing. */
