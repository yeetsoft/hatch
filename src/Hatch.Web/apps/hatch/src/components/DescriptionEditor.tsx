/* A description, read and written in one place.

   Two screens edit one now - the issue page and the board's peek - and one
   copy of the behaviour in each is two markdown renderers, two rules for when
   Save is offered and two ways a refusal is reported, which drift. So the
   toggle, the draft, the dirty rule and the empty state live here, and a
   caller is left with the request it owns and the chrome it draws.

   What is deliberately not here: whether the description has arrived. The
   editor is mounted only once there is a string to edit, so `value` is never
   nullable - which is what lets the issue page, where the description comes
   down with the page, use it with no loading branch at all. */
