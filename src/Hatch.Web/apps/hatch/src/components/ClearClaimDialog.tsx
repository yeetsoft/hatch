/**
 * The speed bump in front of taking a ticket back off a runner.
 *
 * It exists for one sentence, and the sentence is the consequence rather than
 * "are you sure": **clearing the claim does not stop the runner.** The lease is
 * a lock on the board, not a handle on a process - the session keeps running,
 * keeps pushing, and may still move this ticket, because a move is not gated on
 * a token. What clearing does is make the ticket claimable again, so the next
 * pass is free to spawn a second session at it, and then two of them are
 * writing to one branch. That is worth knowing before pressing, and nowhere
 * else on the page says it.
 *
 * Presentational, like CloseSubtreeDialog, and rendered unconditionally for the
 * same reason: the modal's own focus, escape and scrim handling is the one that
 * should run. Dismissing by escape, the scrim or the ✕ means Leave it.

          second session on it, and the two would then both be writing to it.
