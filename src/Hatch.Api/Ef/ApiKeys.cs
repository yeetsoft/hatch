/// Modules/README.md says never happens. The scope strings name modules; the
/// rows do not belong to them.
///
/// Only the SHA-256 of the secret is stored, exactly as for a grant token: a
/// stolen database yields nothing usable, and a lost key is replaced by minting
/// another rather than by looking this one up.
