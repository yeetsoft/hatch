/// Distinct from <see cref="AppVersionController"/>, which answers a different
/// question with a better answer for its own purpose: that one compares
/// content-hashed asset filenames, so a backend-only deploy leaves it unchanged
/// and the wall tablets don't reload for a change they can't see. This one
/// names the commit, which is what an operator watching a rollout needs and
/// what a tablet's reload decision must *not* be keyed on. Both, deliberately.
///
/// Exempt from the auth wall (see AuthGate's allow-list). It names a commit of
/// a repository that is on its way to being public, and an unauthenticated
/// client needs it precisely in order to discover it should re-authenticate
/// against a newer build.
