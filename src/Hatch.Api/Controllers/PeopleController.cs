/// <summary>
/// CRUD for the household's people, plus the two endpoints that move a photo in
/// and out.
///
/// Written against <see cref="AppDbContext"/> directly rather than through a
/// service, matching <see cref="ZonesController"/>: this is admin CRUD over one
/// table, and the only logic worth a seam - what a name may contain, what an
/// upload may be - already has one in <see cref="PersonName"/> and
/// <see cref="PersonPhoto"/>, where it can be tested without an HTTP request in
/// the picture.
///
/// The link between a person and a session is *not* here. It is a column on the
/// grant, so it is written where grants are written
/// (<c>AuthController.LinkGrantPerson</c>) - one FK with one write path. What
/// this controller offers is the read of it, on <see cref="GetSessions"/>.
///
/// Every write here is guarded at Admin, and one of them is the reason the guard is
/// worth having at all: <c>Role</c> is set on this page, so an unguarded
/// PUT would let any enrolled device make itself an administrator, which turns
/// the whole boundary into a formality. The reads, photo included, ask only for
/// User - a name and a photo are what the family apps render next to a note -
/// so a Pending person, who has not been let in, sees none of it.
