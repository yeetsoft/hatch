/// <summary>
/// Quill's whole API: one person's notes.
///
/// Every endpoint begins the same way, and that repetition is the design. The
/// caller's person id is resolved once (<see cref="ICallerIdentity"/>) and is
/// the first clause of every query - so there is no "read a note" path that
/// could be reached without it, and no admin escape hatch beside it that would
/// have to be defended separately.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <b>Every refusal is a 404.</b> No person on this device is a 404, someone
/// else's note id is a 404, and a note that does not exist is a 404 - the same
/// empty body in all three cases. A 403 would confirm that the id names a real
/// note belonging to a real person, which is the one fact a private note has to
/// keep; and "this device has no owner" is not something a device with no owner
/// should learn from the API when the shell has already declined to show it the
/// app at all.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// This is the first controller in Hatch where a person decides an outcome, and
/// it will not be the last - sharing a note with somebody, read or write, is
/// per-resource authorization keyed on a person and nothing else
/// (docs/quill.md). What does not exist yet is a permission model to say that
/// in, so the shape here is the one worth copying rather than improvising on:
/// the person is a *clause in the query* (see LoadAsync), never a check after
/// the rows are loaded, and "who may read this" is one expression that sharing
/// widens rather than a second one beside it.
///
/// What that deliberately is not: nothing here reads Person.Role. There is
/// a global role now - it guards the admin app and the operator verbs behind
/// it (docs/auth-architecture.md, "The admin flag") - and it has nothing to say
/// about a note. An administrator is not a person who may read everyone's
/// notes, and the day somebody wants that, it is a sharing rule rather than a
/// role check.
