/// <summary>
/// The one thing about an issue that an agent may read and may not write: the
/// model and the effort every increment dispatched for it runs on.
///
/// A playbook prices a transition. This prices a ticket, for the story that
/// turns out to be harder than its column suggests - and it beats every
/// playbook that could speak for that ticket, not one transition's worth, so
/// it is still true at three in the morning when nobody is typing.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Its own controller for one verb because of the class-level attribute it does
/// not carry. <see cref="IssuesController"/> accepts the <c>hatch</c> scope on
/// every route it holds, so two more fields on <c>IssuePatchRequest</c> would
/// be an agent that can raise its own budget - the exact edge
/// <see cref="PlaybooksController"/> cuts on purpose (docs/hatch.md, "The one
/// edge that is deliberately cut"). It is cut in the route rather than asked
/// for in a prompt, because a rule an agent is merely told is a rule an agent
/// can reason its way past.
///
/// Reading is open, like everything else a dispatch needs: an agent is entitled
/// to know what it is being spent on, and <see cref="IssueDto"/> carries both
/// fields.
