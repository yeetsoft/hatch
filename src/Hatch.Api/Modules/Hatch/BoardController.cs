/// <summary>
/// The board, in one request: every column and every card in the house.
///
/// One endpoint rather than a column-at-a-time read because the board is the
/// screen the operator lives on (docs/hatch.md, "Goals") and it is refetched
/// after every action - two round trips per drag would be felt, and a board
/// assembled from separate reads can show a card in two columns at once.
///
/// This is also where the WIP meter is read: <see cref="Wip.LoadAsync"/> runs
/// against the same status list and the same instant the cards are drawn
/// against, so the board and its meter never disagree about what is claimed.
