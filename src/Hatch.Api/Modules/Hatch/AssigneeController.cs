/// rarely, surviving every restart. It is deliberately not a claim, which is a
/// machine lease that comes and goes with an increment and shares no column with
/// this.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>Its own controller for the same reason
/// <see cref="IssuePlaybookController"/> is, and cut the same way: no
/// class-level attribute, so the write below inherits no scope from anything.
/// <see cref="IssuesController"/> accepts the <c>hatch</c> scope on every route
/// it holds, so two more fields on <c>IssuePatchRequest</c> would have made this
/// a key's write - and under the loop's <c>people only</c> rule an assignee is a
/// dispatch gate. A key that could write one could clear a person's name off a
/// ticket and hand itself work that was reserved (docs/hatch.md, "The one edge
/// that is deliberately cut"). It is cut in the route rather than asked for in a
/// prompt, because a rule an agent is merely told is a rule an agent can reason
/// its way past.</para>
///
/// <para>Reading is open, like everything else a dispatch needs: an agent has to
/// know whose work it is about to take, and that is precisely the fact that
/// tells it to leave the ticket alone.</para>
