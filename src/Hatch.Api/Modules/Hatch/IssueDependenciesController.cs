/// <summary>
/// What an issue waits on: the two verbs that add and remove an edge.
///
/// Writing one is open to a key, unlike a playbook or a per-issue override
/// (<see cref="IssuePlaybookController"/>). The difference is what the write
/// says: an override raises what an agent is spent, and an edge states a fact
/// about the work - that these two things must land in order. A planning
/// session that has just filed five stories is exactly who should chain them,
/// so this rides the ordinary scope-accepting guard the rest of the module
/// carries.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// There is no <c>GET</c> here. Both lists ride <see cref="IssueDto"/>, which
/// is where the board, the page and the shell need them anyway, and a second
/// route serving the same two arrays would be a second thing to keep in step.
/// Both verbs answer with the whole issue for the same reason: the page
/// repaints from one response instead of composing the new state itself.
/// </remarks>
