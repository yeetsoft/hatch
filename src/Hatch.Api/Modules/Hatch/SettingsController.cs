/// <summary>
/// The two settings a Hatch install of its own configures: the Claude
/// subscription token that drives the battery, and what to call whoever is
/// sitting at this machine.
///
/// Here rather than on the admin app's Settings page because an install with no
/// admin app - which is every install that is only somebody's tracker - still
/// has to be able to set them. They are the same site settings the admin page
/// wrote, under the same keys, stored the same way, so an operator who set the
/// token before this existed finds it already set here.
///
/// Both of those routes carry plain <c>[RequireAdmin]</c> with no
/// <c>AcceptScope</c>, unlike <see cref="UtilizationController"/> and
/// <see cref="LocalPersonController"/> beside them: those are reads an agent has
/// a use for, and these are not. An API key that could write here could set the
/// name every event in the house is signed with, or swap the credential the
/// account's headroom is read through. A person, at a browser, or nobody.
///
/// No class-level attribute even so, and that is the third time this split has
/// been drawn (<see cref="RunnersController"/>, <see cref="AssigneeController"/>,
/// <see cref="IssuePlaybookController"/>): <see cref="GetClaudeToken"/> below is
/// cut the other way - a keyless runner is its ordinary caller - and
/// <c>RequireAdminAttribute</c> is <c>AllowMultiple = false</c>, so a
/// method-level attribute silently *replaces* a class-level one rather than
/// tightening it. Decorating every action explicitly is what keeps the two
/// person-only routes person-only whatever is added beside them.
