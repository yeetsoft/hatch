/// <summary>
/// What the loop is waiting on a person for: a pull request nobody has
/// reviewed, and a question nobody has answered - and, listed but never
/// counted, the pull requests whose branch has stopped merging.
///
/// The nav strip draws it on every page, so it has to be one request rather
/// than two. Two polls can be a poll interval apart, and a badge counting one
/// instant beside a panel drawn from another shows up as a lit control whose
/// list is empty - which is the one failure a widget like this cannot recover
/// from, because after it happens twice nobody reads it again.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Neither half restates a rule that already lives somewhere. Which column is
/// the review column is <see cref="Columns.AwaitingReview"/>'s answer, measured
/// off the board's shape and not off a name, and what makes a question open is
/// <see cref="Questions.Open"/>'s - the same call the board badges a card with
/// and the dispatcher refuses a ticket on. A browser that derived either for
/// itself would be the same rule written twice, in two languages, and the two
/// would drift.
