/// <summary>
/// <em>This one first.</em> One flag on an issue, set by a person and honoured
/// by both halves of Hatch: the board floats the card to the top of its column,
/// and the dispatcher considers every expedited candidate before anything else.
///
/// It is a sort key and not a gate. Every fold an issue already meets still
/// folds it - see <see cref="EfHatchIssue.Expedited"/>, which is where that
/// argument is made and where the second thing it is not is written down.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>Its own controller for the same reason
/// <see cref="AssigneeController"/> and <see cref="IssuePlaybookController"/>
/// are, and cut the same way: no class-level attribute, so the write below
/// inherits no scope from anything. <see cref="IssuesController"/> accepts the
/// <c>hatch</c> scope on every route it holds, so one more field on
/// <c>IssuePatchRequest</c> would have made this a key's write - and expedite
/// decides what the loop reaches for first, so a key that could set one could
/// put its own ticket at the front of every night (docs/hatch.md, "The one edge
/// that is deliberately cut"). It is cut in the route rather than asked for in
/// a prompt, because a rule an agent is merely told is a rule an agent can
/// reason its way past.</para>
///
/// <para>Reading is open, like everything else a dispatch needs: an agent is
/// entitled to know why it was sent where it was sent, and both
/// <see cref="IssueDto"/> and <see cref="IssueCardDto"/> carry the flag.</para>
///
/// <para>There is no <c>hatch expedite</c> at a terminal for the same reason:
/// the CLI authenticates with a key. The terminal shows the flag on
/// <c>board</c>, <c>queue</c> and <c>show</c>, and sets it nowhere.</para>
