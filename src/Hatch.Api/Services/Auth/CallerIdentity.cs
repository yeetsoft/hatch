/// Two things it deliberately hides. The first is the cookie: a module that
/// reads <see cref="AuthCookie"/> and <see cref="AuthOptions"/> for itself is a
/// second implementation of "who is this", and the day the ceremony changes
/// (a passkey, a header from a native shell) it is a second implementation that
/// has to be found. The second is the wall's own switch. <c>Auth:Enabled</c> is
/// false in local development and under <c>AUTH_MODE=none</c>, so
/// <see cref="AuthMiddleware"/> never runs and never attaches a grant - but the
/// browser is still holding a perfectly good cookie, and "who am I" has to
/// answer the same way either way. That fallback used to be a private method on
/// AuthController for exactly this reason; it is here now so there is one copy
