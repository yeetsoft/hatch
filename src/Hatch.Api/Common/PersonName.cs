/// <summary>
/// The one place a person's name is turned from request text into a value the
/// database is allowed to hold.
///
/// The brief was "allow nearly anything - this is a home, not an office", and
/// that is what this does: emoji, scripts, punctuation, a name that is entirely
/// 🦖. What it does not allow is the small set of characters that are not names
/// at all but instructions to the thing displaying them.
///
/// **On the sanitization you would expect and will not find here.** There is no
/// SQL escaping, because every write goes through EF Core's parameterized
/// commands - an escaping pass would be a second, weaker defence in front of a
/// structural one, and the failure mode of that pattern is that someone later
/// concatenates a query believing this class made it safe. There is no HTML
/// escaping either: React escapes at the point of render, and a name stored
/// pre-escaped is a name that reads <c>Bob&amp;amp;Alice</c> the second time
/// someone edits it. Store the truth; escape at the boundary that needs it.
///
/// What is left is the part neither of those covers:
///
/// - **Control characters** (C0/C1). A newline in a name breaks every log line
///   that carries it and every table that renders it, and no one's name has one.
/// - **Bidi and other invisible format characters** (Unicode <c>Cf</c>). This is
///   the Trojan Source class: <c>U+202E</c> reverses the text after it, so a
///   name can rearrange the sentence it appears inside. Zero-width joiners are
///   the deliberate exception - they are load-bearing inside emoji sequences,
///   and dropping them turns 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 into four separate people.
/// - **NFC normalization**, so that the two Unicode spellings of "José" are one
///   string. Without it two people can have names that are equal on screen and
///   different in the database, which is the kind of bug that gets diagnosed as
///   "the search is broken".
/// - **Whitespace collapse**, because a name is not a layout.
///
/// The length rule is counted in grapheme clusters - what a reader would call
/// characters - rather than in the UTF-16 code units the column is measured in.
/// 🇺🇸 is one thing to a person and two chars to .NET; 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 is one thing and
/// eleven. Counting code units would mean a name that looks short being refused
/// for being long, which is unexplainable to whoever is standing at the form.
/// <see cref="MaxChars"/> is the column's own bound and exists so the schema is
/// finite even for a name made entirely of the most expensive graphemes there
/// are; a name can only hit it by trying to.
