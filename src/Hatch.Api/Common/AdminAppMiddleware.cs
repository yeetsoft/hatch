/// Keeps the operator's own apps off screens that have no business rendering
/// them: it serves them to a User and above. The admin app was the first; Hatch is the second, and the boundary is
/// the same one rather than a second copy of it.
///
/// The bundle is the boundary here, not the data behind it - every verb that
/// matters carries <see cref="RequireRoleAttribute"/> of its own, so a copy of
/// the JavaScript would buy an attacker nothing. What this buys is the far more
/// ordinary thing: a household where the operator's tools are not one tap away
/// on a family member's phone, and a page that never renders half-loaded with a
/// column of 403s in it.
///
/// A flat <c>404</c>, and that is the interesting choice. A <c>403</c> here
/// would confirm that an admin app exists at this path and that the caller is
/// simply not welcome in it, which is an invitation to go looking; a 404 is
/// indistinguishable from an install that was built without the bundle, which
/// several are - Program.cs mounts each SPA only if its directory is present.
/// The API's refusals are 403s for exactly the inverse reason
/// (<see cref="RequireRoleAttribute"/>).
///
/// Registered immediately after <see cref="AuthMiddleware"/> and before the
/// /apps static file handlers, because a path check in middleware is the only
/// place that covers both halves of how this app is served: the static assets
/// under /apps/admin *and* the MapFallbackToFile route that answers every
/// client-side deep link beneath it. Guarding one and not the other would leave
/// /apps/admin/devices serving index.html to anyone.
