/// Marks an action - or a whole controller - with the lowest role that may take
/// it. Pending is refused everywhere; <see cref="PersonRole.User"/> reaches the
/// everyday surfaces; <see cref="PersonRole.Admin"/> the operator's own verbs. Runs as an MVC authorization filter, so it refuses before model
/// binding and before the action's own body, which is what keeps a guarded
/// endpoint from doing half its work.
///
/// Opt-in, deliberately, and that is a statement about scope rather than a
/// shortcut. Nothing in Hatch was gated on a person until now, and the honest
/// version of this first step is a constraint placed where a boundary already
/// exists - the admin app's own verbs - with everything else left exactly as
/// open as it was. A deny-by-default filter with an <c>[AllowAnonymous]</c>
/// escape would have been the same amount of code and a much larger claim: it
/// would say the household's apps have been audited for what a family member
/// may do, and they have not been, because there is no permission model yet to
/// audit them against (docs/auth-architecture.md, "A person is an authorization
/// input").
///
/// The refusal is a <c>403</c>, not the <c>404</c> the admin app's bundle gets.
/// The two differ because what they can conceal differs: a bundle that 404s is
/// indistinguishable from an install that never deployed one, while the
/// entities behind these verbs are already listed by unguarded GETs, so there
/// is nothing left for a 404 to hide and a great deal for it to confuse.
