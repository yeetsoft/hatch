/// The one thing every Quartz test in this assembly shares whether it asked to

///
/// <para>xUnit gives each test class its own collection and runs collections in
/// parallel, so without this the class that boots a host - binding that static
/// to the host's <c>LoggerFactory</c> - runs alongside the class that builds
/// schedulers through it. The window is small and real: between the host being
/// disposed and the static being cleared, every <c>GetScheduler</c> in the
/// process resolves a logger off a disposed factory.</para>
///
/// <para>Naming every such class into one collection is where xUnit enforces
/// that, and it is the whole cost - a handful of fast tests and three that need
/// a Postgres, which no longer overlap.</para>
